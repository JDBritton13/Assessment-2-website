<P>My name is Stefan I like animals big and small, I enjoy computing and learning about new technology. I am an electrician but currently started studying to discover what the world of IT has grown into, which specific field I will go into nobody really knows, as it has become such a vast industry. 
    So far I have completed my first university subject which was introduction to programming which was a totally new topic that I had very little knowledge of. It was interesting and I am looking forward to learning more about electronics and how things work on the extra low voltage side of thingsI have sadly never had a dog but currently have 3 rescue cats. 
    It will be a life dream to eventually own my own dog and have room for more animals</P>

<p>Born and raised on the south coast of NSW. I am of aboriginal and Irish descent, my mother’s family being from the Wiradjuri mob and my Father being of Irish heritage. I grew up in a town called batemans bay and I traveled around the state after highschool going from studying audio engineering in byron bay, living out the back of red rock mountain, to studying music in canberra. Although i'm not as adventurous as i used to be and spend a lot of time with family at home, I still always set aside plenty of time for one of my greatest passions. As silly as it may sound, I love to get a few close friends together, pack up the suby and head up into the mountains searching for gold.</p>
